## 👁️ What is a Wallhack in Escape from Tarkov?

A **wallhack** is a cheat that overlays real-time visual info on top of the game world, letting you see players, loot, extract points, and even scavs through walls and terrain. This is known as **ESP** (Extra Sensory Perception), and it’s a core part of most cheat tools for Tarkov.

Perfect for solos, rat-hunters, PvP squads, or loot-focused runs where awareness = survival.
